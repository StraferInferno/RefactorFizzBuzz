    <h1>FizzBuzz Refactor </h1>
    <p>The original FizzBuzz is that for each number from 1 to 100, if it was not not divisible by 3 or 5, printed the number. If it was divisible by 3, the program printed “fizz”. If it’ was divisible by 5, the program printed “buzz”. And finally, if it was divisible by both 3 and 5, the program printed “fizz buzz”.</p>
